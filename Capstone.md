# ANALYSIS
## 1. Most Positively Correlated Stocks: FB & GOOG
### GOOG more expensive relative to FB
### Short GOOG and off-setting Long FB

## 2. Most Negatively Correlated Stocks: FB & NFLX
### Both unidirectional at varying rates with each other.

# CONCLUSION
## MEAN-REVERSION BEHAVIOR OBSERVED in positively correlated stocks.

# FURTHER STUDY
## Mathematically Formal & Sophisticated Analysis:
### - Use Log Returns Instead of Mean Returns
### - Use Live Bid-Ask Prices
### - Neural Networks
### - Use Multiple Stocks with Multiple Weights
